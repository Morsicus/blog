I just survived to my first week at [Scaleway](https://www.scaleway.com/) :).
I was very happy to join this compagny as a tech but i was a little bit concerned about
the "Flex Office" thing...

## What's the "Flex Office" ?
Flex Office is just the idea that you don't have a specific desk to do your job.
One day you can begin in a room, on the desk nearby the window and you can move your ass
when you want on an other room, another desk.

You can even work in a more "relax" environment, like on the couch, balcony ...

## What about my concerns ?

I like to have my desktop, my keyboard, my teammates nearby... The fact is in Flex Office
you have to change this habits.


### I want my desktop !

I used to have a desktop. The laptop was just for meeting/fix little things.

So my first big change was about the laptop. The first challenge is to get used to the keyboard.

There is many big screens at Scaleway. You just have to put your laptop on the desk,
plug-in and you are ready to roll ! This point is very important. You can have a complete desk
in a minute. (15 secs :P)

### I want my (big) keyboard !

__DISCLAIMER__: I'm a BEPO/COLEMAK typer and i love ortholinear keyboards.

I think you can have a keyboard (I will buy a new one in the future - For now i'm just using the laptop keyboard).

But you need something portable. I like the [Typematrix](http://www.typematrix.com/). Maybe the [Ergodox](https://ergodox-ez.com/)
can be a good choice.

So when you take a desk, you plug your keyboard. The rest of the time, you should use your keyboard laptop. Perhaps,
you can put the Typematrix on the laptop and use it when you are in a more unorthodox position (like on a couch).

### Where are my teammates ?

I used to have all my teammates arround me. This was lovely. But the fact is when your team scale up, you probably have some teammates
in another timezone/other places, so you have to change your habits.

In flex office you always have to deal with this kind of situation. I think it's a good training.
Your meetings have to be really well timed, you need to use async communication paths (like tickets, memo ...)

## So, what's the cool part ?

At Scaleway, there is many different sort of rooms.
Some are very peacefull (nobody talks), some are more cozy, others are very animated (musics for example).
There is also rooms for meetings/brainstormings with many whiteboards.
You can change regarding your mood and/or your current work ... It's a very pleasant way to do your job.

## Warnings !!

I listen music when i'm working (coding, troubleshooting ... ). With the flex office - i like, and i think it's the
interesting point - change my working environment often (between 2 and 6 times a day).

I used to plug-in my headphone on my desktop. And with the flex office, it was very annoying.
So i just use my phone instead. So i can keep my music on and change room. It helps to keep the focus.
